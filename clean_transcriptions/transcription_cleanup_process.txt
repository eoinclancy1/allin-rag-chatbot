Each of the csvs in the format "clean_xx.csv" were created as follows:

1. Run AllInChatbot/transcriptions/transcription_cleanup_V2.py to generate the best-effort split into Q&As on the raw text file 
2. Open the "xxv2_1.csv" file in automated_QA_csv folder
3. Add the metadata columns ['Topic', 'Sub-topic', 'Speaker', 'Question', 'Answer'] to the first row.
4. Trim the beginning, end and any other portion of the material that is not relevant to what should be embedded (eg. intro song, introductions, ads, closing remarks)
    These serve as a clean way to deliniate the questions into sections, and should help with further model developments
5. Review the question + answer in each row to verify that it was accurately split 
    In some cases, rows need to be merged: E.g if the interviewer asked a multi-part question
    In others, rows need to be split: E.g if the transcription went awry or when question was posed in the form of a comment, etc.
6. Once the sheet is accurate to the best of your ability
