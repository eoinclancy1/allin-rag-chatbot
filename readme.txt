Next to do:
- DONE: Clean up vivek, christie, kennedy
- DONE: Decide on keeping the post-interview chats or not
- DONE: Get basic answers to bot on single candidate
- DONE: Improve the prompt so that it takes multiple sources
- Nice to have: Can reference the part of the video where it came from (maybe via a second output window where it just pastes the full source used)
- DONE: Add very simple UI
- DONE: Can maintain a conversation with the bot
- IDEAL TO DO: Can answer questions across the candidates (e.g. what are each of their views on X).
----- Might just be easiest to offer a switch between single and everyone Q&A to get out the door
- DONE: Set up testing ground so can compare the different methods by answers to the same Qs 
- DONE: Clean up the directory and files




Notes/Improvements: 
- Opportunity: Sometimes candidate's own rhetorical questions are mis-interpreted as questions 
- In the vivek example, the model just straight up forgot to add periods for a bit, so large text blocks appeared particularly in the question column.
- In certain cases, the whisper model just didn't bother to insert punctuation ( see end of christie and all of vivek)
- Use gpt on each row to set the topic


Other quirks
- have text to speech on each row the chatbot generates
- have a little image of all candidates in the chat model once selected
